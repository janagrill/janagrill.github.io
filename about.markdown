# About this website
This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I use icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/license) for the social links in the header, with the only change being the colour they are displayed in. I also use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to make the text look pretty.
