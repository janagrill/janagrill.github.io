# About this website
This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Resources
I use icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the social links in the header, with the only change being the colour they are displayed in. Please refer to FontAwesome's [license](https://fontawesome.com/license) for more details.

I also use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) font Ubuntu for all the texts on the website. Please refer to Ubuntu font's [license](https://github.com/janagrill/janagrill.github.io/blob/master/fonts/UFL.txt) for more details.
