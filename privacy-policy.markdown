# Privacy Policy
The Calendar Week app was built by Jana Grill, Echinger Str. 16A, 80805 MÃ¼nchen as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Jana Grill at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

## 1.0 Information Collection and Use
The app counts the number of times it has been opened in order to display an App Store review banner after a certain usage time. This piece of information is only stored locally on the user's device. This piece of information is not shared with the Service provider or any other third-party service, nor is it ever sent over the network or uploaded to any server. This piece of information can be deleted from the user's device by deleting the app itself.

No other information is collected or shared.
